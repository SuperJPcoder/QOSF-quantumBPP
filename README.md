# Bin Packing Problem Optimization using Quantum Computing

## Project Overview

This project tackles the classic **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)** using quantum computing. The goal is to minimize the number of bins required to pack items of varying weights. We employ classical ILP methods and transform them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models to leverage quantum computing methods like Quantum Annealing and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

## Objectives

### 1. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
- **Description**: Start with a classical ILP model for the Bin Packing Problem and convert it into a QUBO representation.
- **Steps**:
  - Define the ILP for BPP, including variables, constraints, and the objective function.
  - Implement a QUBO transformation function and test it with different problem sizes (small, medium, large).

### 2. Brute-Force QUBO Solver
- **Description**: Implement a baseline brute-force solution for the QUBO problem.

### 3. Quantum Annealing Solver
- **Description**: Solve the QUBO model using D-Waveâ€™s Ocean framework for quantum annealing.

### 4. Quantum Variational Solver
- **Description**: Explore multiple ansatz structures in a hybrid optimization to solve the QUBO problem.

### 5. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
- **Description**: Implement QAOA from scratch for the QUBO model and compare results with other approaches.

### 6. Results Analysis
- **Description**: Analyze and compare performance, accuracy, and scalability of quantum solutions versus classical methods.
